## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1️⃣ Configure Environment

Create a new folder
```bash
mkdir ./nexus-terminal && cd ./nexus-terminal
```
好的，这是对应的英文版本说明：

---

Download the [**docker-compose.yml**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Heavrnl/nexus-terminal/refs/heads/main/docker-compose.yml) and [**.env**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Heavrnl/nexus-terminal/refs/heads/main/.env) files from the repository to your current directory.


```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Heavrnl/nexus-terminal/refs/heads/main/docker-compose.yml -O docker-compose.yml && wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Heavrnl/nexus-terminal/refs/heads/main/.env -O .env
```


> ⚠️ **Note:**
>
> * For **arm64** users, replace `guacamole/guacd:latest` with `guacamole/guacd:1.6.0-RC1` in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
> * For **armv7** users, please refer to the additional notes below.

Configure nginx
```conf
location / {
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header Range $http_range;
    proxy_set_header If-Range $http_if_range;
    proxy_redirect off;
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:18111;
}
```

Configure IPv6 for Docker (optional — you can skip this if you don't use IPv6 to connect to the server).

Add the following content to `/etc/docker/daemon.json`:
```json
{
  "ipv6": true,
  "fixed-cidr-v6": "fd00::/80",
  "ip6tables": true,
  "experimental": true
}
```
Then restart the Docker service:
```
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

### 2️⃣ Start the Service

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### 3️⃣ Update
Note: Running with docker-compose does not require pulling the source code unless you plan to build it yourself. Simply execute the following commands in the project directory to update.
```bash
docker-compose down
```
```bash
docker-compose pull
```
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
## 📚 Usage Guide

Here are some implicit practical features.

### Command Input Component

1.  **Tab Switching**: When the command input box has focus, use `Alt + ↑/↓` to switch between SSH session tabs, and `Alt + ←/→` to switch between text editor tabs.
2.  **Command Sync** (needs to be enabled in settings): When enabled, text entered in the command input box will be synchronized in real-time to the selected target input source. Use the `↑/↓` keys to select menu command items, then press `Enter` to send the selected command.

### File Manager Component

1.  **Quick File Selection**: When the file search box has focus, you can use the `↑/↓` keys to quickly select files.
2.  **Drag and Drop Upload**: Supports dragging files or folders from outside the browser for uploading. **Note:** When uploading a large number of files or deeply nested folders, it is recommended to compress them first to avoid browser freezes.
3.  **Internal Drag and Drop**: You can directly drag and drop files or folders within the file manager to move them.
4.  **Multiple Selection**: Hold down the `Ctrl` or `Shift` key to select multiple files or folders.
5.  **Context Menu**: Provides common file operations such as copy, paste, cut, delete, rename, and modify permissions.

### Command History Component

1.  **View Full Command**: When a historical command is too long and truncated, hover the mouse over the command to view the complete instruction content.

### Terminal Component

1. Press **Ctrl + Shift + C** to copy, and **Ctrl + Shift + V** to paste.


### General Operations

1.  **Zoom**: In the terminal, file manager, and text editor components, you can use `Ctrl + Mouse Wheel` to zoom.
2. **Sidebar**: The expanded sidebar can have its width adjusted by dragging.
3. **Tab Bar**: Right-clicking on the SSH tab bar or the file manager tab bar will open a context menu with the following options: Close, Close Tabs to the Left, Close Other Tabs, and Close Tabs to the Right.
4. **Tab Group Fold Bar**: You can directly click on the tab name in the view to rename the tab.
5. **Automatic Reconnection**: When the connection is lost, you can press Enter in the command input box or terminal, or click the same SSH connection in the connection list to trigger automatic reconnection.

### Others

1. After adjusting the layout, be sure to enable **"Lock Layout"** in the layout manager to prevent page flickering caused by accidental dragging of split lines when the mouse moves across the interface. This ensures the best user experience.
2. To enable Passkey login, set the `RP_ID` and `RP_ORIGIN` environment variables in the `.env` file.



## ⚠️ Notes

1.  **Dual File Managers**: You can add two file manager components in the layout (experimental feature, may be unstable).
2.  **Multiple Text Editors**: The functionality to add multiple text editors in the same layout has not yet been implemented.
3. For **ARMv7** users, please use the [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/Heavrnl/nexus-terminal/blob/main/doc/arm/docker-compose.yml) provided here.
Since Apache Guacamole does not provide an ARMv7-compatible image for `guacd`, the RDP feature has been disabled, and related images will not be pulled for now.
4. Since I don't have an ARM machine on hand, I haven't conducted actual testing, so unexpected bugs may occur during runtime.
5. For data backup, please back up the **data** folder in the directory yourself. This project does not provide any backup functionality.
